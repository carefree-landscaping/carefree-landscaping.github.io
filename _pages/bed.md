# Bed Clean Up Project

This is an example of a bed project we did. It's a bed that is 123 sq ft that was full of weeds and rocks. We removed the weeds, the rocks and then cleaned the dirt out, redid the rock steps to the house and removed and replaced the brick border. Then as a fininshing touch, we installed new dripline and new plants.
